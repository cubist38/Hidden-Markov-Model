A hidden Markov model (HMM) is a statistical Markov model in which the system being modeled is assumed to be a Markov process — call it X — with unobservable ("hidden") states. [Hidden Markov Model](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hidden_Markov_model)
# POS Tagging
HMMs(Hidden Markov Model) is a Stochastic technique for POS tagging. Hidden Markov models are known for their applications to reinforcement learning and temporal pattern recognition such as speech, handwriting, gesture recognition, musical score following, partial discharges, and bioinformatics.
